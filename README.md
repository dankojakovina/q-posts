# q-test

## Project setup

npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```

### Approximate time
I worked on this something like 15 hours - 20hours
Assignment was simple but I was trying to make it more like a setup for some project with basic components
and structure that will be easy to navigate and build on it.
